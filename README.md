PROJECT TITLE: Not A Tax Haven SG

This project is a website where it calculates income and taxes for residents and non-residents of Singapore.
Each user will create an account and provide details to return a report which details will be provided in a report.

I used the backbone of CS50 Finance for the installation and created a table for each section.
